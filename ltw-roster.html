        <p>Abuse of all kinds from himself and others, and a lack of hope made him become Drax Maysin. But just like anyone else... grew up a fan. But unlike everyone else, He never grew out of wrestling. Drax is better known for his eerie, throat-stratching voice, which has a catchphase, "FEAR THE INSANITY". As far as in-ring style goes, Drax has that underdog persona that which droves LTW fans to love him more. No matter how much bumps and bruises he takes, he always comes back and put up a good match against anybody. Don't underestimate of the Master of the Yo-Yo!!  </p>

A rail of a man, most of his food is taken in liquid form leaving him an emaciated horror to look upon. Upon meeting Meat, sAIN'T endowed him with the power of the Black Rider known as Famine.

        <p>Hometown:Parts Unknown</p>
        <p>Avik Jaress did everything the Gods asked him to. He was promised riches and women and every single thing his heart had desired in what Valhalla was. But when he thought his time came; he had been lied to and not allowed into the heavens. Now that he’s stuck here roaming the earth he’s taking out his frustration and anger on any and everyone. I also included two pics. They aren’t great and I’m getting new ones once everything is open again.</p>

        <p>Kama Kozzy don't take anything seriously. He's just awesome and that's all he need to know. If you're cool and awesome like Kama,then he'll be good friends with you. If not, get out of his way. He got better things to do, like finding out your mom's numbe. Is she single? Have her call him so he can get his shoes from under her bed.</p>
