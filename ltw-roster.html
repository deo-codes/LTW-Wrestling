        <p>sAIN'T is the White Rider from the book of Revelations known as Pestilence. He was sent from the bottomless pit to sow disease and discord amongst the inhabitants of the world of men. Having found HOG and Meat in the woods, he saw untapped potential in the broken flesh and psyches before him. Bringing them together as The RejecKts they walk forth into the world of men to destroy all who oppose them.</p>

        <p>HOG spent his early life tending to the animals on the family farm. It was an idyllic life until his mother was killed in mysterious circumstances. These events left HOG damaged, deranged, and vicious. Discovered wearing the face of the family's prized pig, he was little more than a tool of unfocused destruction. Upon meeting sAIN'T,  HOG has begun to discover a focus and a purpose. He is now a keen edged weapon bestowed with the power of the Red Rider known as War.</p>

        <p>Meat is HOG's uncle and took the loss of his sister in much the same way his nephew did. To this very day Meat hears his sister's disembodied voice from across the void. He drinks heavily to try and quiet her unending talk of woe and despair but no amount of drink can silence the dead. A rail of a man, most of his food is taken in liquid form leaving him an emaciated horror to look upon. Upon meeting Meat, sAIN'T endowed him with the power of the Black Rider known as Famine. His goal is to keep The RejecKts hungry for vengeance and destruction.</p>
